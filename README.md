> Trying to learn something new, (at least) one commit a day

**Resolution of 2017**: doing at least one commit per day on GitHub!

**How I plan to achieve this result**: if I don't have any commit on other projects on a single day, I will force myself to commit something (hopefully) useful on this repo. 

**What is good**: a code snippet, a quote, a bookmark, anything that makes sense to remember/learn.

**What is bad**: random/empty/meaningless commits.
